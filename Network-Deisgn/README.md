**Background**
ComfortHealth provides support and medical care to patients across Ontario, all within the comfort of their own homes. As the elderly population and government incentives continue to rise, so does the demand for ComfortHealth’s services. As seen by the chart below, ComfortHealth has experienced significant growth over the last nine years in each serviced region, allowing for the support of even more patients and a further reduction in the overall operational costs in hospitals.

The last nine years have been excellent for ComfortHealth, and now it is time to use analytics to help strategize a three-year annual service plan. This plan will include information about the hiring and allocation of the workforce in medical facilities, including how the geographical areas covered by ComfortHealth will be served by the agency during these next three years. This report will cover the following managerial objectives:
1.	There are two new possible medical centers that ComfortHealth surveyed and that can be opened in the first year (Centers “E” and “F”). Are they worth the investment?
2.	How should the HPs from each medical center be assigned to the different regions? 
3.	ComfortHealth is concerned about the impact of rejecting too many patients, in that doctors and patients may refrain from suggesting the agency as a viable option to colleagues. How would an (optimal) solution that accepts all patients differ from another with full accept/reject flexibility? Is that a viable option for ComfortHealth? If not, why, and how we could make it viable?
4.	How many new HPs should be hired to each medical center during these next three years?

**Model Insights**
Following the development of several models, the following clear takeaways were derived:
1.	Center F is not worth the investment due to lack of nearby demand a large costs, and center C could be sold or rented out as there is no specific region it services. 
2.	The optimal solution that accepts all patients has a large loss compared to rejecting patients, however rejecting can lead to a sharp reduction in the accuracy of our forecast. Further research must be conducted to determine how many patients can be rejected before our demand begins to drop. Overtime is another potential solution to combat this issue.
3.	It is impossible to open center E or even hire more workers and still make a profit. The hiring cost must be reduced (batch hiring or cheaper advertisements) to make hiring make economic sense.
4.	If demand were to severely drop or if the unknown were to occur, then centers A and B could meet the 2022 demand earning a profit of $2,376,000, while the remaining centers are rented out or sold.

**Final Plan**

2022	
-	Hire no new workers and reallocate workers only using centers A, B, and D while renting out C.
-	Begin researching how to reduce hiring costs
-	Research how many patients can be rejected before our demand drops

2023
-  If hiring costs have been reduced, begin hiring more workers to A, B, and D and potentially open E if enough revenue.
-	 If hiring costs have not dropped, use rejection research, and begin rejecting patients to increase profit while keeping demand the same to the optimal profit of $4,723,656.	

2024 
-	If hiring costs have been reduced and demand is on the same trajectory: open Center E and begin allocating resources to target the Toronto demand
-	If not: continue on as in 2023
