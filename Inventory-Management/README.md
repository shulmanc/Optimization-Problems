**Background**
Athers Food Incorporated is a key player in the shelf-stable foods industry, however, in the last few years even with demand increasing, as well as an increase in revenue, the company has suffered losses in profit.  This can be observed by studying the product data from 2019-2021 of the company's most popular product, a healthy canned protein, which accounts for more than 80% of their sales.

It is hypothesized, that the cause of the reduction in profit was due to an outdated inventory policy that did not consider changes in demand and disruptions, especially ignoring spikes due to the pandemic or even annual trends. However, the counterargument to this claim is that the firm always maintains a large enough inventory and is prepared for unexpected events. It has not experienced a stockout in the past five years (as seen for the past 3 years above), and there are no issues with the current inventory policy. This project evaluated the current inventory policy to determine which argument is correct and proposed alternatives to improve profit if necessary. 

**Alternative Inventory Policies**
The key issue with the current inventory policy is that it does not consider changes in demand, which is why a simple EOQ model was tested. The model produced results that would significantly reduce the business’s cost; however, it would result in almost a million dollars less profit and a much larger number of stock-outs. Building off this EOQ model, the reorder point was altered, adding safety stock at different service levels to compare trade-offs between profit and cost at different levels of stockout risk. It was found that having a lower risk of stockout which came from a larger safety stock added to the reorder point, led to a slightly better profit than the simple EOQ model. Although this new profit was still lower than the profit of the current inventory policy.  The main reason why the profit was lower, was that the optimal Q value ordered each time was not large enough to meet the demand and resulted in a very large number of stockouts.

**Recommended Inventory Policy**
The optimal inventory policy would be to use a flexible EOQ model, that can theoretically order any quantity we wish at any moment in time based on factors like changes in demand and annual trends. Taking the initially developed EOQ model and doubling the optimal order quantity resulted in higher profits than the profit of the current inventory policy. Thus, the current inventory policy should change to a more flexible EOQ model, that considers important changes in demand and annual trends, to order an amount that maximizes the firm’s profit, while also minimizing costs and the number of stockouts. Once further information about current policies is provided, this flexible model will be developed that has already been shown to improve profits compared to the current system, by taking a simple EOQ model and doubling Q to account for the large annual demand.
